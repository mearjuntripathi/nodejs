**Using Google Drive with Node.js**

In situations where storage limitations become a concern, exploring alternative solutions becomes essential. Suppose you're utilizing platforms like GitHub or Versal for hosting frontend applications, which offer restricted storage space, typically around 2GB. In such scenarios, leveraging Google Drive for storing files can be a viable option.

By integrating Google Drive with your Node.js applications, you can harness the robust storage capabilities of Google Cloud. This documentation aims to provide a concise guide on utilizing Google Drive in conjunction with Node.js to manage files efficiently.
